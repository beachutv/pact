# Pact — Source of Truth

> **CRITICAL RULE:** Always stick to the prototype (`pact-app.html`) since we flushed out the features and design there first before starting to build. It would take more time and effort to iterate as we go, and to correct every new thing.

---

## 1. Project Overview

**App Name:** Pact
**Mission:** Help friend groups (~10-20 people) in Metro Manila align schedules and make plans that actually push through.
**Target Users:** Friend circles in Metro Manila who struggle to coordinate hangouts.

---

## 2. Tech Stack Configuration

### Frontend / Hosting — Vercel

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router) with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Hobby tier)
- **Production URL:** https://pact-khaki-seven.vercel.app
- **Team slug:** `beachutvs-projects`
- **Git repo:** https://github.com/beachutv/pact (public)
- **Branch:** `main` (auto-deploys on push)
- **Bundler:** Turbopack

### Database / Auth — Supabase

- **Project ID:** `zxluwryrbpnvsktpxqlj`
- **Region:** Singapore
- **Auth:** Google OAuth (via Supabase Auth)
- **Storage:** `avatars` bucket (public) for profile photos

#### Database Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `users` | User profiles (name, email, color, home_area, home_x/y, birthday, avatar_url, phone, address, share_phone, share_address, theme, precise_loc, live_lat/lng/area/updated_at) |
| `circles` | Friend groups (name, emoji, invite_code, created_by) |
| `circle_members` | Circle membership (circle_id, user_id, role: admin/member) |
| `calendar_connections` | Google Calendar OAuth tokens (access_token, refresh_token, token_expiry, selected_calendars) |
| `busy_blocks` | Hourly busy/free data per user per date (source: google/apple/manual/pact) |
| `pacts` | Planned hangouts (date, win_start, win_end, spot_name/emoji/area, circle_id, occasion, created_by, from_message) |
| `pact_members` | Who's in each pact (pact_id, user_id) |
| `threads` | Chat threads (name, circle_id, color) |
| `thread_members` | Thread membership |
| `messages` | Chat messages (text, date_card proposals, spots, RSVP tracking, reply_to for threaded replies) |
| `message_reactions` | Emoji reactions on messages (message_id, user_id, emoji, unique per combo) |
| `rsvps` | Date card responses (message_id, user_id, response: in/out) |
| `thread_reads` | Unread tracking (thread_id, user_id, last_read_at) |
| `notifications` | App-wide notifications (type: message/pact_new/pact_change/pact_upcoming/spark, title, body, link, read) |
| `occasions` | Special dates (birthdays, anniversaries) |
| `favorite_spots` | Saved locations |

#### Key RLS Functions

- `get_my_circle_ids()` — SECURITY DEFINER, returns circle IDs for current user
- `get_my_circle_mate_ids()` — SECURITY DEFINER, returns user IDs of all circle mates
- `user_thread_ids()` — SECURITY DEFINER, returns thread IDs for current user (breaks circular chat RLS)
- `trg_thread_last_msg` — Trigger: auto-updates threads.last_message_at and last_message_preview on new message

#### Key Patterns

- `crypto.randomUUID()` for client-side ID generation (avoids RLS SELECT-after-INSERT failures)
- `window.location.href` instead of `router.push()` when server components need fresh data
- CASCADE foreign keys on messages, thread_members, thread_reads, rsvps → threads (simplifies deletion)

### Calendar Integration — Google Calendar API

- **GCP Project:** `strange-wharf-502518-i8`
- **OAuth Consent Screen:** Testing mode with sensitive scopes
- **Client ID:** `176863843742-8r23tdiq5f72v0l8i0mjvj88v5pr5mlc.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- **Scopes:** `calendar.readonly`, `calendar.events` (for read + write)
- **Redirect URI (prod):** `https://pact-khaki-seven.vercel.app/api/calendar/connect/callback`

#### How Availability Works

1. User connects Google Calendar via OAuth → tokens stored in `calendar_connections`
2. On calendar page load, auto-sync fires → `/api/calendar/sync` calls Google freeBusy API for all selected calendars across 14 days
3. Busy periods are merged (overlapping blocks combined) and stored as `busy_blocks` rows
4. Calendar grid computes free windows per member, showing best shared availability
5. Sparks detect nearby friends (< 25 min travel) with shared free windows today

### Google Places API

- **API Key:** `AIzaSyDKs-EC4-7NLpKM9UuMNomS4hrDxLNHVkE`
- **Usage:** Autocomplete for plan location input (`/api/places/autocomplete`)
- **Billing:** Free trial ($300 credit, 90 days)
